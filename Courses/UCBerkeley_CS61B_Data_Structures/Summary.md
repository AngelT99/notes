## Lecture 1 Intro, Hello World Java
- **Introduction**
	- What is this course about?
		- Writing code that runs efficiently
			- Good Algorithms
			- Good Data Structure
		- Writing code efficiently
			- Designing, building, testing, and debugging large programs
			- Use of programming tools
				- Git, IntelliJ, JUnit, and various command line tools
			- JAVA (not the focus of the course)
		- Assuming solid foundation in programming fundamentals, including: Object-Oriented programming, recursion, lists and trees
- **Course Logistics**
	- *Phase 1*: Programming Intensive Introduction to Java
		- Weeks 1-4
		- One browser-based programming HW (HW0)
		- Three labs to introduce you various tools
		- Two projects (proj0 and proj1)
	- *Phase 2*: Data Structures
		- Weeks 5-10
		- Incredibly important and foundational material: Expect an CS job interview to learn heavily on this part of the course
		- Two medium sized HWs (HW1, HW2) and one small HW (HW3)
			- Application and deeper insight into data structure
		- One large project (Proj 2A/2B)
			- No autograder. You're responsible for the correctness of your code
		- Standard labs implement data structures (e.g. hash table)
			- Challenge labs are more like hard puzzles using data structures
	- *Phase 3*: Algorithms and Software Engineering
		- Weeks 10-14
		- Labs: Implement a basic algorithm (e.g quick sort)
			- Challenge labs: Hard data structure / algorithms puzzles
		- One medium sized HW: Implement an AI that solves problems using A* algorithm
		- Two projects:
			- Proj2C: BearMaps. Uses data structure from proj2A/2B and algorithm from HW4 to implement a browser-based mapping application
			- Proj 3: Build Your Own World: An open ended project where you build a 2D world with physics according to your own design
- **Hello World**
