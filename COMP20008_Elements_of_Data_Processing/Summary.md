## Lecture 1 Introduction
- **Data Wrangling**
	- What is data wrangling
	- What activities the it encompasses
	- Why it is done
	- Why it is challenging
	- Why it is useful
	- Appreciate the series of activities in data wrangling (the data wrangling pipeline)

## Lecture 2 & 3 Data Formats
- **Regular Expression**
	- Syntax
		- '.'    Any characters
		- '^'   Beginning of a string
		- '$'   End of a string

		- '[^]' Complement of a set of characters
			- [^a-z] matches any characters except a-z
		- Group text with parentheses
			- xy|z != x(y|z)
